<p>Hi, my name is Joseph, I am currently in my third you of an economics and finance degree. I've lived in melbourne my whole life although both of my parents are from Adelaide. Throughout my life i've constantly been involved with sports, mainly playing soccer and basketball for over a decade. I have recently taken a break from sports as I've had to have two knee reconstructions in the past 12 months.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>I decided to choose this subject as one of my electives for my main course, as I believed IT would be a great starting point to expand my broader knowledge on the business world, as IT will always be relevant for the foreseeable future i thought it would be a nice subject to try.</p>
<p>I chose RMIT as my university because as i was doing my research most places recommended it as the best option for an economics course and liked that it was in the city therefore easily accesible for me. During my studies.I hope to learn future skills that will eventually lead to me achieving my dream job.</p>
  
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39676985?searchrequesttoken=92cd5589-51d2-492e-9bdc-20c7efc7d3dc&type=standout">Ideal Job</a> would be one in the stock market, so the one I have picked for this project is a Senior Associate at the company KOSEC.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53844492/63185793-3f3f7580-c09e-11e9-8212-4693826fef3f.png" alt="Ideal Job" width="400" height="500"></p>

<p>The position at KOSEC involves, building strong relationships with Accountants and Financial Planners to establish new business channels, the ability to conduct conferences and semenars, and to close and sell marketing campaigns to new clients. This job is desirable to me as I would like a job allowing me to have constant interactions with clients and the ability to build relationships with them, it is also fairly high paying and allows me to travel through work which is an added bonus.<p>
<p><img src="" alt="" width="134" height="182"></p>
<p>This job requires a great amount of experience, you need to have a proven history of dealing with clients in stockbroking and extensive experience in the stock market as well as experience in increasing sales and profits.</p>
<p>So far in my developement I am yet to complete any of the required qualifications for this job, although I have begun to learn some skills through my various part time jobs. This skills mainly involved customer service and how to deal with people, which will be helpful in almost any future job I get.
<p> To reach the required qualifications I plan to finsih my bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance and then continue studying to do my honours and then potentially Masters in a field of business. From their I plan to get a graduate role at some firm and work my way up, learning the skills and experience that I need for my ideal job.

<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>

<p> The results of the personality and learning tests shown above have agreed with what I have already believed to be my ideal learning situations and my personality type. These results will influence my behaviour when working in a team as it will allow me to work to my strengths and the knowledge of my weakness' will help me form a team to counteract them.</p>
<p>As the Myers-Briggs test showed I am an ISFP type, I can play to the traits in a team environment such as, being able to take a back seat and "go with the flow" of the group allowing others to take lead. Due to these traits I am compatible with those that have ESFJ personality types due to their high organisation skills and ability to be outspoken, thus when forming groups I should look to pair with this type or one similar.</p>

<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<p>For young inexperienced drivers, one thing that is rarely taught well, if at all is how to read parking signs. It’s hard to find someone who hasn’t experienced the self-doubt of “can I park here without getting fined”. Many people see parking as a huge deterrent for driving to places like the inner city because of how hard and confusing it can be to find a legal park. So for my project idea I propose an app that will simplify these signs for drivers, allow drivers to pay for parking in-app if necessary and help them find the closest and cheapest parking options.</p>

<p>My motivation for this project was that if there were to be an app like this made, it would make the lives for all commuters easier and would minimise the risk of getting a despised fine for no reason. Additionally, the likes of this app will make for smoother transitions for traffic, as less people would be driving around the streets looking for parks, as it will be easier for them to find accessible parking. This app would be able to make a profit by either running ads or taking a small percentage of parking fees.</p>

<p>In order to make an app like this possible many features would be necessary to add. Geo-Location would be one of the most important aspects of this app; it could potentially gain a link with apps similar to Google maps in order to make a clean transition from driving to your wanted destination to finding a park nearby. The location service on most mobile phones will be able to pinpoint users real time position, using the cellular providers GPS systems to find the location of users.</p>

<p>Another feature would be a search bar, this is a fairly simple feature, it will allow you to type in the address or location of your destination for example the MCG, and then pop up with the closest parking areas. In this feature there will be a way to sort through time allocated parking, allowing users to pick whether they want to search for all-day parking, 4 hour parking etc. Along with this they will also be able to sort through the options to find the cheapest parking area that meets their set criteria.</p>

<p>The app would also have a feature to allow users to pay for their parking, this feature would require the users to put in the location of their park, or enter a specific area code for the parking bay. This feature would allow users to check into a parking spot and enter their estimated time of use, also allowing for this price to change if they decide to stay in that parking bay for more or less time than originally thought.</p>

<p>As there is a lot of street parking that is free for certain amount of times, this app will include a feature similar to the one used in apps such as Gas Buddy. This feature will allow for users to enter the location of their park and the amount of time people are allowed to stay in this parking spot, in order to update the database with more and more parking spots to commonly used areas each day. Customers that do this frequently to help out others may receive some sort of benefit or reward.</p>

<p>In order to make this app practical and user friendly, the app would require to be designed to have compatibility across all commonly used mobile phones and platforms to allow it to be well suited for use across different sizes of screens, phones and tablets.</p>

<p>For this app to be developed it is likely that the code used to create it would be either Python or Java. Code language such as Java is the most frequently used for high performing apps to help power the service to the users and begins the foundation of the app.  The use of cloud systems will help solve any storage issues that would need to be taken into account when working with the data.</p>

<p>To make an app there is an incredible amount of skills involved that needed to be taken into consideration to make this app plausible. To begin with there would need to be a person fluent in coding languages, mainly Java and C++ in order to develop the app to be produced. For an app of this type, it would be possible to create and find the hardware, software and skills fairly easily for this app due to many of the functions being apparent in other apps already and the high demand for app creation in the modern day.</p>

<p>If this project were to become a success, it would help aid people in finding parks during busy times and limiting their likelihood of getting fined for parking in the wrong areas.  Not only would this app help assist drivers but also the likes of home owners in busy areas will hopefully see a decrease in the amount of cars illegally parked in permit only zones or people parking in other zones for unlawfully extended amount of times.</p>

<p>There are many potentially obstacles and drawbacks to any app created, the most prevalent for this project would be the cost of creation. The more functions and programs that an app needs to run the higher the cost will be, increasing the risk of paying for this expensive app in case it fails. Another obstacle would be the function involving user help to submit where free legal parks are, in the early stages if not many people find out about the app or choose to use it this function could be largely irrelevant.</p>
