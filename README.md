<p>Hi, my name is Joseph, I am currently in my third you of an economics and finance degree. I've lived in melbourne my whole life although both of my parents are from Adelaide. Throughout my life i've constantly been involved with sports, mainly playing soccer and basketball for over a decade. I have recently taken a break from sports as I've had to hav two knee reconstructions in the past 12 months.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>I decided to choose this subject as one of my electives for my main course, as I believed IT would be a great starting point to expand my broader knowledge on the business world, as IT will always be relevant for the foreseeable future i thought it would be a nice subject to try.</p>
  <p>I chose RMIT as my university because as i was doing my research most places recommended it as the best option for an economics course and liked that it was in the city therefore easily accesible for me. During my studies.I hope to learn future skills that will eventually lead to me achieving my dream job.</p>

<p>This job requires a great amount of experience, you need to have a proven history of dealing with clients in stockbroking and extensive experience in the stock market as well as experience in increasing sales and profits.</p>
<p>So far in my developement I am yet to complete any of the required qualifications for this job, although I have begun to learn some skills through my various part time jobs. This skills mainly involved customer service and how to deal with people, which will be helpful in almost any future job I get.
<p> To reach the required qualifications I plan to finsih my bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance and then continue studying to do my honours and then potentially Masters in a field of business. From their I plan to get a graduate role at some firm and work my way up, learning the skills and experience that I need for my ideal job.
